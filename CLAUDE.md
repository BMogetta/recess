# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

### Docker (primary development workflow)

```bash
make up          # Start data layer + game-server (postgres, redis, game-server)
make up-app      # Add traefik + frontend
make up-all      # Add full observability stack (OTel, Tempo, Loki, Prometheus, Grafana)
make up-prod     # Start with production profile (adds PgBouncer + pg-backup)
make up-test     # Start with TEST_MODE=true for e2e tests
make down        # Stop all services
make reset       # Hard reset — wipes volumes, images, and networks
```

### Backend (Go)

The monorepo uses a Go workspace (`go.work`), so most `go` commands work from the repo root.

```bash
# Run all Go tests across all modules
go test ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test ./services/game-server/internal/domain/runtime/...

# Run a single test
go test -run TestName ./path/to/package/...

# Run the game server locally (outside Docker)
cd services/game-server && go run ./cmd/server
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev       # Vite dev server
npm run build     # TypeScript check + Vite production build
npm test          # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:ui   # Vitest with UI
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

```bash
make up-test           # Start in test mode
make seed-test         # Create test players → frontend/tests/e2e/.players.json
make smoke-test        # Fast API smoke test with curl (~5s, no browser)
make test              # Run all Playwright tests
make test-one NAME="partial test name"  # Run single test
make test-ui           # Interactive Playwright UI
make clean-test        # Remove auth state and player fixtures
```

### Setup

```bash
make setup    # Check required tools + install frontend deps
```

### Code Generation

```bash
# Regenerate frontend/src/lib/schema-generated.zod.ts from JSON Schema definitions
# Generates Zod schemas + inferred TypeScript types
make gen-types

# Regenerate protobuf Go stubs from .proto definitions
# Requires: protoc, protoc-gen-go, protoc-gen-go-grpc
make gen-proto
```

### Adding dependencies

When adding a new external tool or dependency that is required to build or run
the project, also add it to `make setup` in the Makefile so it is checked
during environment verification.

### Changing Traefik routes

When adding, removing, or modifying Traefik routing rules in `docker-compose*.yml`,
also update `scripts/test-routing.sh` to match. Run `make test-routing` to verify.

## Architecture

Recess is a **microservices monorepo**. All services live under `services/` and share code via `shared/` through a Go workspace.

### Services

| Service | Purpose | HTTP | gRPC |
|---------|---------|------|------|
| `services/game-server` | Game engine, lobby, sessions, bots | 8080 | 9080 |
| `services/auth-service` | GitHub OAuth, JWT issuance/validation | 8081 | — |
| `services/user-service` | Profiles, friends, bans, mutes, reports, admin, settings | 8082 | 9082 |
| `services/chat-service` | Room messages, DMs | 8083 | — |
| `services/ws-gateway` | WebSocket hub, real-time fan-out | 8084 | — |
| `services/rating-service` | ELO/MMR calculations, leaderboards | 8085 | 9085 |
| `services/notification-service` | In-app notifications, Redis consumer | 8086 | — |
| `services/match-service` | Ranked matchmaking queue | 8087 | — |

game-server exposes gRPC on `:9080` implementing `lobby.v1.LobbyService` (CreateRankedRoom) and `game.v1.GameService` (StartSession, IsParticipant). match-service is the sole caller.

All traffic from the frontend goes through **Traefik** (reverse proxy). There is no direct service-to-service HTTP — inter-service calls use gRPC (synchronous) or one of three async transports.

### Communication Patterns

- **gRPC + Protobuf** — synchronous calls where the caller needs a response (e.g., game-server → rating-service to fetch MMR before matchmaking). Proto definitions live in `shared/proto/`.

- **Redis Streams** — async fan-out events: one publisher, multiple consuming services, each service consumes once across its replicas via a consumer group. Used for `game.session.finished` (rating + user) and `player.banned` (auth + match + notification). Stream name = event name; one consumer group per consuming service. Producer + consumer helpers in `shared/streams/`.

- **Asynq** — async point-to-point tasks: one producer, one consuming service. Used for game-server timers (turn timeouts), match-service expiry, `bot:activate:{botID}` (match → bot-runner), `notification:friendship-*` / `notification:achievement-unlocked` (user → notification). Built-in retry, scheduling, DLQ. Tasks live on per-service queues (`match`, `bot-activate`, `notification`).

- **Redis Pub/Sub** — async fan-out where every consumer **replica** must see every message:
  - Per-connection WS hubs (`room.{roomID}`, `player.{playerID}`) — only the pod hosting the connection has a relevant subscription, so fan-out is naturally targeted.
  - ws-gateway service consumer (`player.session.revoked`, `admin.broadcast.sent`) — every ws-gateway replica must receive each event so the right pod can disconnect a player or each pod can broadcast to its own clients. Streams or Asynq with a single consumer group/queue would deliver to only one pod, which is wrong here.
  - Other channels still on Pub/Sub for legacy reasons (`player.unbanned`, no consumer wired today): no functional need to migrate.

  Pub/Sub consumers in this repo MUST be naturally idempotent or fan-out-safe — a global SETNX dedupe across replicas breaks the fan-out semantic.

- **REST/JSON** — frontend ↔ services only, never service-to-service.

All async events carry an `event_id` UUID for idempotency. Event structs live in `shared/events/`. See `shared/contracts.md` for the complete contract map and versioning rules.

### Shared Module (`shared/`)

- `shared/proto/` — Protobuf definitions + generated Go stubs (rating, user, lobby, game)
- `shared/events/` — Async event structs (Streams payloads, Asynq task payloads, Pub/Sub messages)
- `shared/streams/` — Redis Streams Producer + Worker (consumer group + claim loop + DLQ)
- `shared/domain/rating/` — ELO/MMR engine (shared between game-server and rating-service)
- `shared/domain/matchmaking/` — matchmaker algorithm (shared between match-service and simulate tool)
- `shared/middleware/` — JWT auth, OpenTelemetry HTTP middleware, JSON Schema request validation
- `shared/schemas/` — JSON Schema definitions (single source of truth for API DTOs)
  - `shared/schemas/defs/` — reusable type definitions (`$ref` targets)
  - Root-level `*.request.json` / `*.response.json` — endpoint-specific schemas
- `shared/redis/` — Redis client wrapper
- `shared/telemetry/` — OTel setup (traces, metrics, logs)
- `shared/config/` — Environment variable loader
- `shared/db/migrations/` — SQL migrations as `NNN_name.up.sql` (golang-migrate format, applied by the `db-migrations` ArgoCD Job in k8s and by the postgres entrypoint in docker-compose). `shared/db/seeds/dev.sql` (test fixtures) and `prod.sql` (real owners) are split.
- `shared/errors/` — Shared API error types

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

React 19 + TypeScript app served via Nginx in Docker.

- **Routing:** TanStack Router (file-based, `src/routes/`)
- **Server state:** TanStack Query
- **Client state:** Zustand (`src/stores/`)
- **Linting:** Biome
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e in `tests/e2e/`)

Feature modules in `src/features/`: `auth`, `game`, `lobby`, `room`, `admin`, `devtools`.
Game renderers (pluggable) in `src/games/`: `tictactoe`, `rootaccess`.

#### Game Package Boundaries

Each game directory (`src/games/{game}/`) is a self-contained package with a
barrel `index.ts` that exposes its public API: main component, state type,
rules component, card types, and assets.

- All exports in internal files **must** have `/** @package */` JSDoc.
  This marks them as package-private — only importable within the same game
  directory. External code must import from the barrel (`@/games/{game}`).
- Biome's `noPrivateImports` rule enforces this for relative-path imports.
  Aliased `@/` imports are not yet resolved by Biome (known limitation).
- When adding a new game: create `src/games/{game}/index.ts`, annotate all
  internal exports with `/** @package */`, and register in `registry.tsx`
  importing from the barrel.

Card UI kit in `src/ui/cards/` — game-agnostic animated card components (Card, CardHand, CardPile, CardZone) powered by Framer Motion (`motion` package). Each game provides its own face content via render props (e.g., `CardFace` in rootaccess). The kit handles flip, hover lift, fan layout, fly animations, and AnimatePresence transitions.

#### Styling Guidelines

##### Typography & Units

- `--font-scale` is a **unitless multiplier** (default `1`). Users can change it
  at runtime via JS (`document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--font-scale', n)`).
- All `--text-*` tokens are already pre-multiplied: `calc(Nrem * var(--font-scale))`.
  Never multiply by `--font-scale` again at the usage site.
- Typography → always `rem`-based tokens (`--text-sm`, `--text-base`, etc.)
- Component spacing → `--space-N` tokens (px internally, scale with layout not font)
- Borders, radius, shadows → raw `px` values, they do not scale with font
- Never hardcode color values in component rules — always use semantic tokens
  (`--color-interactive-glow`, not `rgba(212, 168, 83, 0.2)`)

##### Tokens

- Always use semantic variables (`--color-bg-surface`, not primitives like `--slate-900`)
- Spacing only via `--space-N` tokens, never hardcoded pixel values
- Z-index only via `--z-*` scale tokens (`--z-dropdown`, `--z-modal`, `--z-toast`, etc.)
- For themes, the accent color is always `--color-interactive`

##### Components

- Buttons: `.btn` + `.btn-{variant}` classes from global.css, never inline styles for buttons
- Cards: `.card` class from global.css, overrides in `.module.css`
- Do not create new utility classes without updating `global.css`

##### Conventions

- CSS Modules for all page and component styles
- Local variables at the top of the module or in `:local` scope
- Never use `!important`

#### Responsive

Desktop-first strategy. Default styles target desktop (1280px+).
Use `max-width` media queries to adapt down:
- `1024px` — small desktop / laptop adjustments
- `768px`  — tablet: collapse sidebars, simplify navigation
- `640px`  — mobile: single column, hide secondary panels

Never use `min-width` unless building a genuinely mobile-first component.
Breakpoint values: 640 / 768 / 1024 / 1280px — no other values.
For global font scaling on small screens, adjust `--font-scale` on `:root`,
never override individual `--text-*` tokens.

#### Accessibility

Target: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

- Interactive elements must be semantic: `<button>` for actions, `<a>` for navigation
- Every `<input>` must have an associated `<label>` via `htmlFor` or `aria-label`
- Never use `outline: none` without replacing with `box-shadow` focus ring
  using `var(--color-focus-ring)`
- Dynamic content that updates (game state, chat messages, turn changes)
  must use `aria-live="polite"`
- Game board elements without native HTML equivalent must have `role` + `aria-label`
- Modals/panels must have `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and `aria-labelledby`
  linking to their heading
- Avoid `div`/`span` with `onClick` — always use `button` or anchor

#### JSON Schema & Zod

JSON Schema is the **single source of truth** for all API DTOs shared between
Go and TypeScript. The pipeline:

```
shared/schemas/*.json  →  Go: embedded + validated at runtime (middleware)
                       →  TS: Zod schemas + inferred types (generated)
```

##### Schema file conventions

- Endpoint schemas: `{verb}_{noun}.{request|response}.json` (e.g., `create_room.request.json`)
- Shared types: `defs/{type_name}.json` (e.g., `defs/game_session.json`)
- Title field → PascalCase type name (e.g., `"title": "CreateRoomRequest"`)
- Use `$ref` to reference defs: `{ "$ref": "defs/game_session.json" }`
- No `DTO` suffix — use domain names (`GameSession`, not `GameSessionDTO`)

##### Adding a new endpoint

1. Create `shared/schemas/{verb}_{noun}.request.json` and/or `.response.json`
2. If the response uses new types, create them in `shared/schemas/defs/`
3. Run `make gen-types` to regenerate `frontend/src/lib/schema-generated.zod.ts`
4. In the game-server router, add `validate("{verb}_{noun}.request")` middleware
5. In the frontend API layer, use `validatedRequest(schema, path, init)` for the response

##### Validation rules

- **Backend request validation**: all POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints with a body
  MUST have a JSON Schema and the `validate()` middleware wired in the router.
  The middleware returns 400 with structured error details on failure.
- **Frontend response validation**: use `validatedRequest()` with the Zod schema
  for all endpoints that have a response schema. This validates the server
  response at runtime. `SchemaError` is thrown on mismatch — loud in dev/test
  (console.error + full details), generic message in production.
- **Frontend request validation**: NOT needed. TypeScript types enforce request
  shape at compile time, and the backend validates at runtime. Only validate
  user input with Zod when building request bodies from form data or dynamic
  sources where TypeScript alone can't guarantee correctness (e.g., `minLength`,
  numeric ranges).
- Endpoints without a response schema (void, other services) use `request<T>()`
  without Zod validation.

#### Test IDs

All interactive and assertable elements must have a `data-testid` attribute for
Playwright e2e tests. Test IDs are **conditionally rendered** — they appear in
dev and test mode but are stripped from production builds.

- Use the `testId()` helper from `@/utils/testId`:
  ```tsx
  import { testId } from '@/utils/testId'
  <button {...testId('submit-btn')}>Submit</button>
  ```
- Dynamic IDs use template literals: `{...testId(\`player-row-${id}\`)}`
- Never hardcode `data-testid="..."` directly — always use the helper
- The helper checks `import.meta.env.DEV || import.meta.env.VITE_TEST_MODE`
- Vitest runs with `DEV=true`, Playwright runs with `VITE_TEST_MODE=true`
- When adding new interactive elements, include a `testId` — e2e tests depend on
  stable selectors to avoid fragile CSS/text-based queries

### Database

PostgreSQL with schema separation:
- Default schema — rooms, sessions, moves, events, notifications, chat (owned by game-server)
- `users` schema — profiles, friendships, bans, mutes, reports (owned by user-service)
- `ratings` schema — ratings and rating history (owned by rating-service)

### Redis Key Inventory

See `shared/redis-keymap.md` for the full key map with TTLs and owners.

### Observability

When running `make up-all`:
- **Tempo** — distributed traces (gRPC from all Go services + HTTP from frontend)
- **Loki + Promtail** — container logs
- **Prometheus** — metrics scraped from `/metrics` endpoints
- **Grafana** — dashboards at `http://grafana.localhost`

### Turn Timers & Match Expiry

Turn timers (game-server) and match confirmation expiry (match-service) use **Asynq** — a distributed task queue backed by Redis. Tasks are persisted and guaranteed exactly-once delivery, making the system safe for multi-instance horizontal scaling.

### Security

#### Ownership checks (Broken Access Control prevention)

Every endpoint that takes `{playerID}` in the URL **must** verify the caller
owns the resource before proceeding. The canonical pattern:

```go
callerID, _ := sharedmw.PlayerIDFromContext(r.Context())
if callerID != playerID {
    writeError(w, http.StatusForbidden, "forbidden")
    return
}
```

Rules:
- Apply this check in every handler where `playerID` identifies a private
  resource (settings, friends, DMs, unread counts, conversations).
- For room-scoped endpoints (`{roomID}`), verify the caller is a room
  participant via `store.IsRoomParticipant` before reading or mutating data.
- If a resource is intentionally public (profiles, achievements), document it
  with a comment above the handler explaining why no ownership check is needed.
- Never trust a `player_id` from the request body — always derive identity from
  `sharedmw.PlayerIDFromContext` (JWT context). Request body fields named
  `player_id` should not exist; if they do, the handler must ignore them.

#### Store-level authorization

When a store operation is sensitive (mark-as-read, report, hide), the SQL query
itself must scope to the authorized identity — don't rely only on the handler
check. Example: `WHERE id = $1 AND receiver_id = $2` instead of `WHERE id = $1`.

#### Injection prevention

- SQL: always use parameterized queries (`$1`, `$2`). Never use `fmt.Sprintf`
  or string concatenation for SQL.
- Redis: build keys via helper functions (`RoomChannelKey`, `PlayerChannelKey`),
  never from raw user input.
- Errors: return generic messages ("forbidden", "not found"). Never reflect
  user input or internal details (query text, stack traces) in responses.

## Authorship attribution (mandatory)

**Never add Claude/Anthropic attribution to anything.** This is a hard rule with
no exceptions:

- No `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` (or any AI tool) trailers in commit messages.
- No "Generated with Claude Code" / "🤖 Generated with ..." footers in commit
  messages, PR descriptions, or PR comments.
- No `Claude-Session:` / session-link trailers anywhere.
- No AI-attribution lines in code comments, changelogs, docs, or issue text.

Commits and PRs must read as if authored directly by the repo owner. If a
harness or template injects such a footer, strip it before committing or
opening the PR.

## Release flow (conventional commits)

Releases are automated via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action).
Each deployable (8 services + frontend) has its own version, its own release
PR, and its own tag — bumped only by commits that scope to that component.

### Commit message scope

Use conventional-commit format with a **component scope** matching the per-component
release-please configs (`<component>/release-please-config.json`). Valid scopes:

| Scope | Bumps |
|---|---|
| `game-server`, `auth-service`, `user-service`, `chat-service`, `rating-service`, `match-service`, `notification-service`, `ws-gateway` | the matching Go service |
| `frontend` | the React app |

Examples:

```
feat(game-server): add ranked tiebreaker rule
fix(chat): dedupe dm_read notifications
refactor(rating): move ELO to shared/domain
```

Unscoped commits or commits scoped to anything outside the table above
(`docs`, `ci`, `chore`, `build`, `shared`, ad-hoc scopes) **do not trigger a
release**. They still follow conventional-commits so the changelog stays clean.

### Breaking changes

Add `!` after the type to mark a breaking change:

```
feat(game-server)!: remove deprecated /v1/rooms endpoint
```

This bumps major even for `0.x` components (treating the component as "post-v1" for
semver purposes).

### Tag format

Release-please creates tags like `<component>-v<version>` (e.g., `game-server-v1.2.3`).
The release workflow parses this tag and builds/publishes
`ghcr.io/<owner>/recess-<component>:v<version>` (+ `vX.Y` + `latest` tags),
then mints a GitHub App install token to push an image.tag bump to
[`BMogetta/recess-deploy`](https://github.com/BMogetta/recess-deploy) so
ArgoCD syncs the new tag onto the cluster.

## Deployment

This repo holds **source code only**. All k8s manifests, Helm charts,
ArgoCD Applications, sealed secrets, and cluster bootstrap docs live in
[`BMogetta/recess-deploy`](https://github.com/BMogetta/recess-deploy).
The two-repo split keeps GitOps (what the cluster runs) separate from
source (what the app does).
